# PCB design for temperature seonsor
Temperature sensors are commonly used in electronic devices to indicate temperature. You can see that the digital clock shows the room temperature value. This is because it has a built-in temperature sensor. This project will show you how to design a digital temperature sensor circuit 
## Project Discription
The PCb was designed for the following schematic.
